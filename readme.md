##Overview/description of the project: Creative Container Solutions
CCS designs and builds high-quality, eco-friendly shipping container spaces tailored for living, working, and adventuring. Our spaces are built to last, thoughtfully designed, and fully customizable. Whether you're setting up a mobile office, embracing tiny home living, or seeking an off-grid escape, CCS delivers smart, modern container solutions that do more with less.

##Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered
This site includes a carousel to display the gallery images for the site. The Navbar uses anchor tags to direct you to the About, Gallery and Contact pages, as well as a tag that directs you to a sperate .html for the floor plans. The contact us section also houses a form that links to formspree.io.

##Technologies Used ( .html , .css )
I used .html, .css, Javascript, and Bootstrap

##Ideas for future improvement (minimum of 3)
I would like to update the gallery with more images, add a map to the contact section, and change the form labels in the contact section to be left justified instead of centered. I would like the Floor plans link on the navbar to be a dropdown so that all of the plans can be listed and anchored.
